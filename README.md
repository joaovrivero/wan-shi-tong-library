## Wan Shi Tong's Library

Welcome to Wan Shi Tong's Library system! This project was developed as the final project for the Data Structures course in college. It's a command-line library management system designed to handle book borrowing using queues and library storage using lists.

## Introduction

Wan Shi Tong's Library is a digital representation of a library system, inspired by the vast knowledge repository of the Spirit Library from the Avatar: The Last Airbender series.
